        <p>
            I am Yadhunath Tharakeswaran, and I am currently majoring in Computer Science in the University of Kansas. My technical proficiency extends on C++, Python, JavaScript
            HTML, CSS, and Haskell. My career goal is to pursue a Software Development Engineering position in one of the top Technology firm at US. Apart from that, I am also interested
            in a number of co-curricular activities such as playing, Cricket, video games, badminton, painting, and sketching. Talking about sketching, I just wanted to show you guys a 
            simple face-sketching video that I found to be very interesting to me! And to watch such interesting tutorials you can check the profile below.
